# Decision-Tree-Drug-Prediction
Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Classification Model using scikit-learn. The dataset used contains patient health parameters, and the objective is to predict the type of drug that should be prescribed based on these parameters.

Throughout the project, I explored Decision Tree algorithms, built the model, visualized the tree structure, and evaluated the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

Objectives

After completing this project, I was able to:

Develop a classification model using the Decision Tree Algorithm

Apply Decision Tree Classification on a real-world dataset

Visualize the decision tree for better understanding

Evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy and other metrics

Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is based on drug prediction using health parameters of patients. It includes features like:

Age

Sex

Blood Pressure

Cholesterol Levels

Na-to-K Ratio

Drug Type (Target variable)

The goal is to predict the correct drug category for a patient based on their health profile.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn
